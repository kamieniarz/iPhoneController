## Installation  

Run the following commands and fill out config.  
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/versx/iPhoneController/master/install.sh && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh && rm install.sh
```

### App Deployment  
After building `iPhoneController` for the first time:  
1. In your `bin` folder, create a `releases/config` folder  
1. Copy your GC `config.json` to the new `releases/config` folder  
1. In your `bin` folder, create a `profiles` folder  
1. Copy your mobile provisioning profile to the new `profiles` folder  

### Single App Mode  
In order to reapply the SAM profile, you'll need to do the following:  
1. Copy `sam_pogo.mobileconfig` to your `bin` folder  
1. In AC2, click on the `Apple Configurator 2` menu and choose `Install Automation Tools`.  
1. In AC2, click on the `Apple Configurator 2` menu and choose `Preferences` > `Organization` > click on your org and choose `Export Supervision Identity` at the bottom left.  
1. Move the .crt and .der files to your `bin` folder and rename them to `org.crt` and `org.der`.  

## Updating  
1. `git pull` (from root of folder)  
1. `~/.dotnet/dotnet build`  
1. `cd bin`  
1. `~/.dotnet/dotnet iPhoneController.dll`  

## Running  
From the `bin` folder type the following:  
`~/.dotnet/dotnet iPhoneController.dll`  

## Running with PM2 (recommended)
Once everything is setup and running appropriately, you can add this to PM2 ecosysetm.config.js so it automatically starts:

    module.exports = {
      apps: [
        {
          name: "iPhoneController",
          script: "iPhoneController.dll",
          watch: false,
          cwd: "/path/to/iPhoneController/bin",
          interpreter: "/Users/you/.dotnet/dotnet",
          instances: 1,
          exec_mode: "fork",
          max_restarts: 250,
          restart_delay: 300
        }
      ]
    }

Adjust path and interpreter as required.  

### PM2 PLEASE NOTE

If you have useIosDeploy=false and the bot doesn't respond, check console.  If you get the following error or similar you will need to fix PM2 permissions, see below.

    1|iPhoneController  | 21:49 [ERROR] [BOT] User xxx tried executing command screen and unknown error occurred.
    1|iPhoneController  | : System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.
    1|iPhoneController  |    at iPhoneController.Commands.PhoneControl.ScreenshotAsync(CommandContext ctx, String phoneNames) in
    /private/path/to/iPhoneController/src/Commands/PhoneControl.cs:line 115

### Fixing PM2 Permissions
1. From Mac terminal
` cat ~/Library/LaunchAgents/pm2.admin.plist`

look for the following line and note the path

`<string>/usr/local/lib/node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 resurrect</string>`

2. From Mac desktop, Click the Apple, Open System Preferences

3. Click Security and Privacy, click the lock to make changes and enter your password

4. On left, click full disk access then either click the plus and add the path from earlier OR open finder and navigate to the path and drag / drop into here

If you've already started iPhoneController with PM2 you'll now want to delete and relaunch after the above changes, this will now let PM2 access the files needed to run cfgutil.

## FAQ
Q. How do I get the profile ID?  
A. Run `security find-identity -p codesigning`  

Q. I'm receiveing `{"Command":"list","Output":{},"Type"::CommandOutput","Devices":[]}` when `cfgutil --format JSON list` is run.  
A. Reinstall Apple Configurator 2 automation tools  

Q. I'm trying to reapply SAM but get error "failed to get ECID for device"?  
A. You likely have `useIosDeploy = true`, you need this to be "false" which uses `cfgutil` in order to support re-applying SAM.

## TODO  
- Localization
